# Responsiveness-Tutorial
This repository contains the techniques for making responsive landing page 
<br>
Creating a responsive website is crucial for ensuring a great user experience across all devices. 
<br>
Here are some techniques I used while building a responsive landing page with HTML and CSS:
<br>

AVOID FIXED SIZES IN PIXELS: Instead of using fixed pixel sizes, use relative units like percentages, vw, vh, and em to make your layout flexible.
<br>
<br>
CSS FLEXBOX: Flexbox is your friend! It helps in creating flexible and responsive layouts without relying on absolute positioning.
<br>
<br>
CSS MEDIA QUERIES: Media queries allow you to apply specific styles based on the device’s screen size. Here’s the basic syntax for a media query:
<br>
<br>

@media (max-width: 600px) {
    <br>
  /* Responsive styles go here */
  <br>
}
<br>
<br>
RESPONSIVE TYPOGRAPHY: Use scalable units like rem and em for fonts to ensure text adjusts smoothly across devices.
<br>
<br>
MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH: Start designing for the smallest screen first, then add enhancements for larger screens.
<br>
<br>
FLEXIBLE IMAGES AND MEDIA: Ensure images and videos scale appropriately by using max-width properties and responsive units.
